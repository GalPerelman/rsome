### Distributionally robust optimization for medical appointment scheduling

In this example,  we consider a medical appointment scheduling problem described in [Adaptive distributionally robust optimization](http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2016/03/5353.pdf), where \\(N\\) patients arrive at their stipulated schedule and may have to wait in a queue to be served by a physician. The patientsâ€™ consultation times are uncertain and their arrival schedules are determined at the first stage, which can influence the waiting times of the patients and the overtime of the physician.

A distributionally robust optimization model presented below is used to minimize the worst-case expected total cost of patients waiting and physician overtime over a partial cross moment ambiguity set.

$$
\begin{align}
\min~&\sup\limits_{\mathbb{P}\in\mathcal{F}}~\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}}\left[\sum\limits_{j=1}^N y_i(\tilde{\pmb{z}}, \tilde{\pmb{u}}) + \gamma y_{N+1}(\tilde{\pmb{z}}, \tilde{\pmb{u}})\right] && \\
\text{s.t.}~&y_j(\pmb{z}, \pmb{u}) - y_{j-1}(\pmb{z}, \pmb{u}) + x_{j+1} \geq z_{j-1} && \forall (\pmb{z}, \pmb{u})\in \mathcal{Z}, ~\forall j \in \{2, 3, ..., N+1\} \\
&\pmb{y}(\pmb{z}, \pmb{u}) \geq \pmb{0}, && \forall (\pmb{z}, \pmb{u})\in \mathcal{Z} \\
&\pmb{x} \geq \pmb{0},~\sum\limits_{j=1}^N x_j \leq T && \\
\end{align}
$$

with the random variable \\(\tilde{z}\_j\\) representing the uncertain consultation time of each patient. The first-stage decision \\(x_j\\) denotes the inter-interval time between patient \\(j\\) to the adjacent patient \\(j+1\\), for \\(j\in[N-1]\\), and \\(x_N\\) is the arrival of the last patient and the scheduled completion time for the physician before overtime commences. The second-stage decision \\(y_j\\) denotes the waiting time of patient \\(j\\), with \\(i \in [N]\\) and \\(y_{N+1}\\) represents the overtime of the physician. In order to achieve a tractable formulation, it is approximated by the decision rule \\(\pmb{y}(\pmb{z}, \pmb{u})\\) which affinely adapts to random variables \\(\pmb{z}\\) and auxiliary variables \\(\pmb{u}\\).

In this numerical experiment, we consider the lifted form of the partial cross moment ambiguity set \\(\mathcal{F}\\) given below.

$$
\begin{align}
\mathcal{F} =
\left\{
\mathbb{P}\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^N\times\mathbb{R}^{N+1})
\left|
\begin{array}
~(\tilde{\pmb{z}}, \tilde{\pmb{u}}) \sim \mathbb{P} \\
\pmb{z} \geq \pmb{0} & \\
(z_j - \mu_j)^2 \leq u_j, & \forall j \in [N] \\
(\pmb{1}^T(\pmb{z} - \pmb{\mu}))^2 \leq u_{N+1} \\  
\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}}(\tilde{\pmb{z}}) = \pmb{\mu} & \\
\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}}(\tilde{u}_j) \leq \sigma_j, & \forall j \in [N] \\
\mathbb{E}_{\mathbb{P}}(\tilde{u}_N) \leq \pmb{1}^T\pmb{\Sigma}\pmb{1}
\end{array}
\right.
\right\}.
\end{align}
$$

Values of model and ambiguity set parameters are specified as follows:
- Number of patients: \\(N=8\\),
- Unit cost of physician overtime: \\(\gamma=2\\),
- Correlation parameter: \\(\alpha=0.25\\),
- Expected consultation times: \\(\pmb{\mu}\\) are random numbers uniformly distributed between \\([30, 60]\\),
- Standard deviations of the consultation times: \\(\sigma_j=\mu_j\epsilon_j\\), where \\(\epsilon_j\\) is a random number uniformly distributed between [0, 0.3],
- The scheduled completion time for the physician before overtime commences:

$$
T=\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\mu_j + 0.5\sqrt{\sum\limits_{j=1}^N\sigma_j^2},
$$

- Covariance matrix: \\(\pmb{\Sigma}\\), with its elements to be:

$$
\left[\pmb{\Sigma}\right]_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
\alpha \sigma_i\sigma_j & \text{if }i\not=j \\
\sigma_j^2 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$
